            <p>This is a story about South Africa’s schoolchildren, specifically the ones who enrolled in grade one in 2005 in one of the thousands of public schools around the country. In an ideal world, the majority of those children would have emerged at the end of 2016, after 12 years of schooling, with a national senior certificate (what used to be known as a matric). But this is far from the reality.</p>

               Many of the students who don't make it through to grade 12 within 12 years will still reach, and pass, matric a few years later. Research shows that about 53% of South Africans successfully complete grade 12, but some are in their late 20s when they write their exams. For example, in 2017 about half the people who wrote the exams were older than 18 years, and more than 766 of them were 27 years old.

                Passing matric and getting a degree or diploma is not a guarantee of success in life, but achieving those qualifications does improve school leavers' chances of being employed.

                People who don’t pass matric are likely to find it the hardest to get a job. One in three people (33%) without a matric are unemployed. If you pass matric you're more likely to find a job: 28% of people with a matric are unemployed. But if you get a tertiary qualification your chances of finding a job increase significantly. Nine out of 10 people (93-95%) with a university degree are employed, as are four out of five people (83%) with some other tertiary qualification, according to figures published by StatsSA.
