            <p>This is a story about South Africa’s schoolchildren. The ones who started school in 2005 when they enrolled in grade one in one of the thousands of government schools around the country. In an ideal world, the majority of these children would have emerged at the end of 2016, after 12 years of schooling, with a national senior certificate (what used to be known as a matric). Unfortunately, this is far from the reality in South Africa's school system.</p>
            <p>
                    In January 2005  <span class="em">1.2 million</span> children started grade one in South Africa’s government schools. Each of the circles below represents 2,500 pupils.</p>
