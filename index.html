            <p>This is a story about South Africa’s schoolchildren. The ones who started school in 2005 when they enrolled in grade one in one of the thousands of government schools around the country. In an ideal world, the majority of these children would have emerged at the end of 2016, after 12 years of schooling, with a national senior certificate (what used to be known as a matric). Unfortunately, this is far from the reality in South Africa's school system.</p>
            <p>
                    In January 2005  <span class="em">1.2 million</span> children started grade one in South Africa’s government schools. Each of the circles below represents 2,500 pupils.</p>

        <p>A high number of learners have to repeat grades in South Africa. Research has shown that about <span class="em">one in three</span> children in SA had to repeat a grade at school.

Research has shown that <span class="em">just over half</span> of the learners in South Africa’s schools had <span class="em">repeated at least one grade</span> by the time they reached grades 10 to 12. <span class="em">One in 10</span> of them has repeated a grade at least <span class="em">three times</span>.

               Many of the students that don't make it through to grade 12 within 12 years will still reach, and pass, matric a few years later.
